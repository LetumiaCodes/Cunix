# Cunix

This is not a finished project and i dont plan on abandoning the project either and want to roll out updates until im satisfied with it. This is just a small program that mimics a UNIX style OS in your terminal.

# Installation 
- Install git on your system
- git clone the repo
- Run the application by entering ./Cunix_beta

# Disclamer 

Again this is really just a showcase and not a final version so if you dont like it odds are stuff will get better, and leave some suggestions on what to add. Keep in mind im only one developer so updates might take a while but i will make sure to archive old versions here.
